[Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary) is an [incredible tool](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/README?id=watch-the-demo-on-youtube) for managing design tokens and static assets. Its biggest super power is the ability to transform those tokens and assets into any number of representations, like CSS variables, SASS variables, etc.

Out of the box, Style Dictionary does not provide a way to showcase your tokens. This makes sense because design systems are unique and diverse, and providing a one-size-fits-all solution is a large ask.

This repo provides a couple of very minimal examples that have worked for me. My hope is that their minimalism makes them easy to extend, customize, and remix.

Examples:

- Single-page static style guide using EJS templates ([source](https://github.com/jbarreiros/style-dictionary-style-guide/tree/main/examples/ejs)) ([preview](https://jbarreiros.github.io/style-dictionary-style-guide/ejs/))
- Storybook (_working on it_)
