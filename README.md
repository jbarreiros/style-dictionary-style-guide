[Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary) is an [incredible tool](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/README?id=watch-the-demo-on-youtube) for managing design tokens and static assets. Its biggest super power is the ability to transform those tokens and static assets into any number of representations, like CSS variables, SASS variables... literally anything.

Out of the box, Style Dictionary does not provide a way to showcase your tokens. This makes sense because design systems are unique and diverse, and providing a one-size-fits-all solution is a large ask.

This repo provides a couple of very minimal examples that, I hope, are not too complicated to extend, customize, and remix.

_Note, I have zero experience with mobile, and unsure how representing android/ios apps would affect any of this._
